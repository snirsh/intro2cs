=====================================================
Our main program is ex11.py, in this program we have different methods with
each one creating or using a different functions.
our function list is:
plot_func - the drawing function. this function receives a range and draws a
            the graph there (we use segments to divide it into smaller
            linear lines)
const_function - creates the constant function of c s.t f(x) = c
identity -  creates the identity function s.t f(x) = x
sin_function - creates the function sin(x)
sum_functions - with the input of g, h as two functions the function will
                create the function f(x) such that f(x) = g(x) + h(x)
sub_functions - with the input of g, h as two functions the function will
                create the function f(x) such that f(x) = g(x) - h(x)
mul_functions - with the input of g, h as two functions the function will
                create the function f(x) such that f(x) = g(x) * h(x)
div_functions - with the input of g, h as two functions the function will
                create the function f(x) such that f(x) = g(x) / h(x)
solves      -   return the solution to f in the range between x0 and x1
inverse     -   creates f s.t. f(g(x)) = x
compose     -   return the f which is the compose of g and h
derivative  -   return f s.t. f(x) = g'(x)
definite_integral - returns the definitive integral of given f(x) from x0 to
                x1
integral_function - return F such that F'(x) = f(x)
