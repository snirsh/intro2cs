=====================================================
the program that is written in ex7.py, using hanoi_game.py, for one of the
functions. where hanoi_game.py is responsible for the GUI for one of our
functions.

ex7.py is consisted of different functions that mostly use recursion for
their purpose.
here is a small description of the main functions:
print_to_n()    printing all the numbers from 1 to n
print_reversed()printing all the numbers from n to 1
is_prime()      checking if a given number is a prime number
divisors()      a function that will return a list with all the divisors of
                n from 1 to n.
exp_n_x()       a function that will calculate the sum(from 0 to n) exp of x
play_hanoi()    a recursive function that let's us play the Towers of Hanoi
                game using the GUI from hanoi_game.py
print_binary_sequences()  this function prints all the binary sequences of n
                          size
print sequences() a function that will print all the possible sequences of a
                given the sequences will be of n size (given value)
print_no_repetition_sequences() printing all the possible sequences just
                                like the last function but it will not print
                                all the repetitions.
no_repetition_sequences_list()  creating a list with all the possible sequences
                                except for the repetitions.
