=  Description:  =
==================

There are 5 different .py files
1. calculate_mathematical_expression:
   a code that has two functions that the first one calculates a mathematical
   expression using n1, n2, and a
   the second function calculates the same thing using a string input when n1
   and n2 are given numbers and a
   is the mathematical notation.
2. largest_and_smallest:
   a code that calculates the biggest number and the smallest number using
   three numbers given to it.
3. quadratic_equation
   a code that has two functions that the first one calculates the quadratic
   equation using three numbers given to it
   and the second function calculates the quadratic equation by calling the
   first equation with the users input
4. shapes:
   a code that has four functions that the first one calculates the area of a
   circle by given radius.
   the second function calculates the area of a rectangle by two given edges.
   the third function calculates the area of a trapezoid by two given edges and
   a given height.
   and the fourth function asks the user what area he chooses to calculate and
   by the given input and calls the right
   function that was described above.
5. bmi:
   a code that calculate the bmi using spell per hour and wand length and
   returns a boolean value.
   if the bmi is between 24.9 and 18.5 it will return true else it will return
   false.

                                        using two numbers and a notation
largest_and_smallest.py                 calculates the max number and the
                                        min number of three given numbers
quadratic_equation.py                   calculates the quadratic equation
                                        by three given numbers
shapes.py                               calculates the areas of a circle, a
                                        rectangle or a trapezoid by the given
                                        user's input.
bmi.py                                  calculates the bmi of a wizard using
                                        two given numbers.
