=====================================================
First we have a simple function named read_article_links which reads a text
file and creates the base of this exercise.
In this exercise we've created two classes: Article and WikiNetwork.
=ARTICLE=
The Article object is a simple object that has name (article's name which is
given) and neighbors which is all the articles he links to.
list of functions in article:
init, get_name, add_neighbor, get_neighbors, __repr__, __len__,__contains__

=WikiNetwork=
a dictionary of articles that doest different functions to get more
information about how the articles are linked to each other.
list of functions in WikiNetwork:
init, create_articles(i've added a creator for init and update functions),
update_network, get_articles(network values),get_title(network keys),
__repr__, __len__,__contains__, __getitem__, page_rank, get_money(helper for
page rank that i've created), jaccard_index, travel_path_iterator,
rank_article(i've added as helper for travel_path_iterator), friends_by_depth
( CHECK ex10.py FILE FOR MORE INFO ABOUT EACH OF THE FUNCTIONS)
