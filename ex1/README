README        This file
hello_turtle.py         Contains the main method to draw a petal a flower an advanced flower and to draw a flower bed
			or a three flower garden

math_print.py           Contains the main method with 6 tasks. 
			task 1 prints out the golden ratio
			task 2 prints out 5 squared
			task 3 prints out the square root of 4 squared + 5 squared or pitagoras formula that gives us the hipotenuse
			task 4 prints out pi
			task 5 prints out e
			task 6 prints out all the squares areas with edges rising from 1 to 10

======================

the difference between python 2 and 3 is:
1. standard library improvments
2. serveral aspects of the core language have been adjusted to be easier for new programmers
